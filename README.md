The "get_next_line" (GNL) project is a common assignment in the 42 school curriculum and in other programming courses. The goal of this project is to write a function, get_next_line, that reads a line from a file descriptor (usually a file or the standard input) and returns that line without the newline character. The function should be able to handle multiple file descriptors.
Here is an explanation of the key aspects of the "get_next_line" project:

1. Function Signature:
The get_next_line function usually has the following signature:
char get_next_line(int fd);
fd is the file descriptor from which the function reads, and line is the address of a pointer where the line read will be stored.
2. Reading from File Descriptors:
The function reads from the specified file descriptor (fd) until a newline character ('\n') is encountered or the end of the file is reached.
It should handle reading from multiple file descriptors simultaneously.
3. Memory Management:
The function needs to dynamically allocate memory for the line it reads and return that allocated memory through the line parameter.
It is the responsibility of the caller to free the allocated memory when it is no longer needed.
4. Handling Buffer Sizes:
The function typically uses a static or dynamic buffer to read data in chunks from the file descriptor. The size of this buffer is an important consideration for efficiency and correct behavior.
5. Return Values:
The function returns 1 when a line has been read successfully, 0 when the end of the file has been reached, and -1 in case of an error.
6. Static Variables:
The function often uses static variables to keep track of the current state of the file descriptor, such as the position in the file or the contents of the buffer.
